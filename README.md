A wordle inspired rock paper scissors game

Here is how to set it up

You may have to install pnpm https://pnpm.io/installation

For the server
1. Open a terminal
2. cd into server 
3. run pnpm install 
4. run node index.js or nodemon index.js when developing to watch live changes, this runs the backend node.js server on localhost:3000

For the client
5. Open a new terminal
6. cd into client
7. run pnpm install
8. run pnpm dev, this runs a vite react app on localhost:5173

To test open the localhost:5173 in a browser window and an incognito browser window and click play on both sites.
